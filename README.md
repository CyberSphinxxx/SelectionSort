# Selection Sort Algorithm

---------------------------------------------------
**Description:**

This Python script implements the Selection Sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the list and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion.

The user is prompted to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces.

The script then sorts the list in ascending order using the Selection Sort algorithm and displays the sorted array.

---------------------------------------------------
**Functionality:**

- **Sorting:** Implements the Selection Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers.
- **User Input:** Prompts the user to input a list of numbers.
- **Output:** Displays the sorted array after sorting.

---------------------------------------------------
**Example of the output:**

Enter the list of numbers separated by spaces: 7 2 4 1 5

Sorted array: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7]


---------------------------------------------------
**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using Python (`python selection_sort.py`).
4. Enter the list of numbers separated by spaces as prompted.
5. The script will output the sorted array.
